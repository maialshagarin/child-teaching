    <h2> The importance of teaching child <h/>
        <p>
            children at their earliest ages should learn and realize the importance of
             education in their lives...... <br>
             Show them that education is the ticket to fulfilling their dreams and having a productive life.<br> 
              Teach the value of education early in a child's life.
             Children are naturally curious and observant.

            Key points

            Development is how your child grows physically and emotionally and learns to communicate, think and  socialise.<br>
            In the first five years of life, your child’s brain develops more and faster than at any other time  in his life.<br>
            Your relationship with your child is one of the most important influences on your child’s learning and development.<br>
            In the early years, your child’s main way of learning and developing is through play.<br>
